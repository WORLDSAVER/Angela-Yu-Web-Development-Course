APIs can either be used to create software as we did with jQuery API where we 
accessed methods functions etc of jQuery and we did not write out our own JS 
code or APIs can be used to interract with external software and use their data 
examples include when Tinder uses Facebook's data on the Instagram profile photos of 
users their likes and interests etc and showcases it on their own app.

When we use an API our own server sends a request to someone elses server and 
their server sends us a response.

 https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming,Misc?format=xml&blacklistFlags=nsfw,sexist&type=single&lang=ru&amount=2 

 In the above URL https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke is the API endpoint, in many cases if we 
 just type in the endpoint in our url we may get an error.

 To prevent the error we mention the API endpoint path which is done by using / and then mentioning the path 
 from where we will fetch the data. /Programming,Misc is the path, we could also have /Programming only
 , here gives us jokes from either Programming path or Miscellaneous path.

 ?format=xml&blacklistFlags=nsfw,sexist&type=single&lang=ru&amount=2, all these are the parameters which are used 
 to make our API call more defined, parameters are written after a ? and they contain key value pairs, 
 where the key is first written then we use = and after = we write the value, parameters are seperated using 
 &(ampersand) and , can also be used to assign multiple values to same parameter.

 We can query external websites for the data they have using APIs.

 ?format=xml&blacklistFlags=nsfw,sexist&type=single&lang=ru&amount=2 order of the parameters does not matter 
 as long as we seperate them by &
